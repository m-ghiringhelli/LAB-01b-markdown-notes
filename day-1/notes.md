# DAY 1 NOTES
## Zoom Tips
* stay muted until it's your turn to talk!
* keep your camera on when possible to help others feel engaged
* use reactions or chat to communicate without talking
## Keyboard Shortcuts
Use keyboard shortcuts to make your workflow easier and more efficient!

Shortcut|Command|Purpose
---|---|---
Launching | CMD+Space Bar | Finding a program and opening it
Switching | CMD+TAB | Move quickly between multiple programs
Quitting | CMD+Q | Exit the program quickly

## Terminal
The terminal is a text-based format for manipulating files.
## Markdown
Markdown is the language/syntax used to style text files for programs (like the one you're reading now! How meta!)
## Git and GitHub
### **Add, Commit, and Push**
There are three steps to syncing your local work with GitHub. Imagine you are shipping items to a central warehouse:
1. **ADD** - placing your items (files) to be shipped in a centralized staging area so you don't lose track of them
1. **COMMIT** - officially declare that these are the items (files) that you want to be part of this shipment
1. **PUSH** - the items (files) are, through the miracle of electricity, practically instantaneously shipped/offloaded into the warehouse
## Using VSCode
VSCode offers similar functionality to _the terminal_ with a host of other features! You can split your screen so you can see how your changes are affecting output. You can still use the terminal but you can also manipulate text files and see the markdown displayed in real-time! Pretty neat!
